<i> Bangladesh, 28 December </i>
<p> My  name is Arpa. I'm studying Diploma of computing at Deakin College. This is my 2nd trimester. The city I was born in is called Chittagong. I'm very friendly and honest as a person.<br> I love working with computer. This is why I chose IT as my major. In the future I would love to develope different softwares for computer and mobile.<br> I would also love to contribute to the development of my country. </p>

<p>There are some really great tourist spots in Bangladesh one should visit. Three of them are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sundarbans</b></dt>
<dd>Sundarbans is the home of the Royal Bengal Tiger. Its compact rain forests are criss crossed by a network of rivers and creeks. One finds here tides flowing in two directions in the <br> same creek and often tigers swimming across a river or huge crocodiles basking in the sun. Other wildlife in this region is cheetahs, spotted dears,<br> moneys, pythons, wild bears and hyenas. The forest is reachable by river from Khulna and Mongla. There are relaxing houses for<br> the guests to stay and enjoy the pure nature with all its charm and majesty.</dd>
<dt><b>Cox's Bazar</b></dt>
<dd>Cox's Bazar is a seaside town, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. It is known for its wide and long sandy beach, which is considered by many as the world's longest<br> natural sandy sea beach. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 125 kilometres (78 mi) sandy sea beach with a gentle slope. It is located 152 kilometres<br> (94 mi) south of the Chittagong Seaport. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, whose literal translation means "yellow <br> flower". Its other old name was "Palongkee". </dd>
<dt><b>St. Martin's Island</b></dt>
<dd>It’s the country’s only coral island and it's beaches do actually match the hype. It also has more bungalow-style accommodation, which adds to the beach vibe. St Martin’s is home to a<br> friendly, tomorrow-never-comes population of around 7000, the majority of whom are Muslim, and live primarily off fishing, although the small amount of land<br> on the centre of the island is also farmed. The island is fairly small – about 6km in length and rarely more than 1km wide – so<br> it’s easy to navigate. Rickshaws are available, but you can also just walk around it from beach to beach. The area around the jetty,<br> on the northeast tip of the island, is called Narikeldia; there there are a few hotels and restaurants.</dd>
